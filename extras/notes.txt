python code here

from os import walk
for (dirpath, dirnames, filenames) in walk('.'):
    f.append(filenames[0])
    continue

from random import sample
random_real_images = sample(f, 500)

with open('out.txt', 'w') as f:
    for r in random_real_images:
         f.write(f'{r}\n')


this created out.txt with 500 random real images.
then i wrote custom shell script to copy each one into a single folder

for i in `cat out.txt`; do cp */$i 500_rand_real; done


then i manually looked at real images to ensure each had only one face in the image.

note that first selection of 500 images yielded (about 350) without other recognizable parts of humans in them

second set was selected in the same way. dupes were removed. all were moved to same folder. then sort -R was used to remove the 159 extra from the second pass.

getting the fake face images

used for basis of getting image from website.
sleep added so website wouldn't block my requests


import requests

url = 'https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/image'

for i in range(500):
    response = requests.get(url)
    with open(f'image{str(i)}.jpg', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    sleep(10)
